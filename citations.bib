	abstract = {Cervical dystonia (CD), the most common focal dystonia encountered in neurologic practice, is a chronic disorder in which the muscles of the neck involuntarily contract and cause abnormal postures and movements of the head, neck, and shoulders. Treatment of CD prior to botulinum toxin was unsatisfactory, as existing therapies often did not improve symptoms. The use of botulinum toxin for CD grew out of its success in treating blepharospasm, another type of focal dystonia. On the basis of results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, onabotulinumtoxinA was approved in 2000 in the US for the treatment of CD in adults in order to alleviate abnormal head position and neck pain. A subsequent large observational trial further demonstrated the effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA for CD, showing improvements in various rating scales, physician-reported measures, and profound positive effects on patient quality of life, including in amelioration of pain and improvements in work productivity. In addition, onabotulinumtoxinA treatment also reduced the complications of CD, as patients no longer develop contractures (permanent muscle and tendon shortening from prolonged untreated dystonia), which markedly limited the range of neck motion. The onset of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment also accompanied advances in understanding the functional anatomy of neck muscles, basal ganglia physiology, and video and other recording technology. Following the success of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of CD, its use has been expanded into numerous other therapeutic indications, and these advances stimulated educational and training programs by various neurologic and other medical societies.},

	abstract = {Background: Cervical dystonia is the most common form of focal dystonia and is the most studied neurological condition in patients receiving botulinum toxin. The placebo response to botulinum toxin has not been studied. Objectives: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the peak and duration of placebo response in people with cervical dystonia receiving botulinum toxin in randomized, blinded controlled clinical trials. Methods: Three databases and two trial registers were searched by a biomedical librarian in September 2023. Covidence was used for screening titles and abstracts and full text. Two authors independently screened each record and collected data from the included articles. Microsoft Excel was used for data collection. The Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool in randomized trials was used by two authors for each included study. A third author resolved conflicts during screening and discrepancies during data collection and risk of bias assessment. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of the mean reduction in the TWSTRS total score at 4 weeks post injection, to assess the clinical change in the placebo arm overall and by TWSTRS pain, severity, and disability scales.Results: Twelve studies, with moderate overall risk of bias, that included 2,145 participants with 580 randomized to placebo, were included in the systematic review. Clinical changes in the placebo arm were mild with a mean reduction of Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total score of 3.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6 - 4.4) four weeks post injection. TWSTRS pain score at week four was 0.9 (95\% CI: 0.6 - 1.1; I2 = 59\%). TWSTRS severity score at week four was 1.7 (95\% CI: 1.3 - 2.0; I2 = 63\%). TWSTRS disability score at week four was 0.7 (95\% CI: 0.3 – 1.0 ; I2 = 63\%). Duration of benefit ranged from 45.1 to 76.3 days with a mean duration of 57.6 days. Dropouts in patients randomized to placebo were due to lack of efficacy, pain, neck weakness, fatigue, and tiredness. Conclusion: This information on placebo response will be useful in estimating sample size and interpreting participant benefit in future interventional studies of cervical dystonia.},
