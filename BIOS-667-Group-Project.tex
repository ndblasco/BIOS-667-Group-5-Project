\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The purpose of this project is to examine the effects of botulism toxin
type B (BotB) to treat cervical dystonia over time. Cervical dystonia
(CD) is a chronic neurological disorder, in which patients have painful
involuntary contractions in neck muscles. CD is more prevalent in women
(Jankovic et al., 2023). The prevalence of CD is estimated to be 28-183
cases per million. The data comes from a multicenter randomized clinical
trial for cervical dystonia patients with 9 U.S. sites. Botulism toxin
types A and B are first-line treatments for CD (Wetmore et al., 2025).
The treatment groups included in the study were placebo, 5000 U BotB,
and 10000 U BotB. The response variable is Toronto Western Spasmodic
Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total score, which ranges from 0 to 87
and is comprised of disability (0-32), pain (0-20), and severity (0-35)
subscores. Only total score is included in this data. The TWSTRS score
was measured at week 0 (baseline), and 2,4,8,12, and 16 weeks after
treatment start. Site is included in the dataset but no further details
about site were included in the available dataset documentation.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Statistical
Analyses}}{Statistical Analyses}}\label{statistical-analyses}

Number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum
(min) and maximum (max) were provided for age. Mean and SD were
calculated for TWSTRS score at baseline. Frequencies and percentages
were reported for categorical variables. GLM, GLMM, and GEE models were
fit using TWSTRS total score as the response variable. For GLM, age,
sex, week, and treatment were used as covariates with male and placebo
being the reference groups. For the GEE and GLMM models, week, age, sex,
treatment, and treatment \(\times\) week interaction were included in
the model again with male and placebo being the reference groups. Both
random slope and random intercept models were fit. ANOVA was used to
compare the random slope and random intercept models. A Gaussian link
function was used for all three model types. Statistical analyses were
performed using R (version 4.4.2, R Core Team, 2024).

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Study
Population}}{Study Population}}\label{study-population}

To be included in the study, patients must have had CD for at least 1
year involving two or more muscles and CD continued response to BotA
treatment. Patients also had to have TWSTRS score \(\geq 20\) with
severity score \(\geq 10\), disability score \(\geq 3\), and pain score
\(\geq 1\). Patients were at least 18 years old, minimum weight of 46
kg, and had acceptable phsyical and neurological exams as well as labs.
Patients who had neurotoxin injection in the last 4 months were
exlcuded. Prior participation in BotB trials precluded patients from
enrolling in the study (Brashear et al., 1999). The study included 109
patients (67 (61\%)) females. In the study, 36 patients were randomized
to placebo, 36 were randomized to 5000U BotB and 37 were randomized to
10000 BotB. The mean age was 55.5 (12.1) years. Median age was 56.0
years. The mean TWSTRS score at baseline was 45.7 (9.7). Demographic and
baseline characteristics were similar among the three treatment groups.
Pearson's Chi Square test was used to compare sex differences among
treatment groups. One-way ANOVA was used to compare differences among
treatment groups for TWSTRS total score at baseline and age (Table 1).

\subsubsection{Generalized Linear Model
(GLM)}\label{generalized-linear-model-glm}

A generalized linear model (GLM model) using a Gaussian link was fit
including week, treatment, age, and sex as predictors (Table 2).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lrrrr@{}}
\caption{GLM Model Summary (Gaussian Link)}\tabularnewline

\endlastfoot
(Intercept) & 37.673 & 2.582 & 14.588 & 0.000 \\
week & 0.235 & 0.089 & 2.631 & 0.009 \\
treat5000 U & 0.005 & 1.248 & 0.004 & 0.997 \\

age & 0.017 & 0.042 & 0.396 & 0.692 \\
sexFemale & 2.183 & 1.071 & 2.038 & 0.042 \\
\end{longtable}

The coefficient for week was statistically significant, indicating an
overall linear trend in TWSTRS score over time. the coefficient for sex
was also statistically significant, indicating a difference in TWSTRS
score between females and males. Male is used as the reference group, so
females have a TWSTRS score that is 2.18 points higher than males, on
average holding everything else constant. However, because the GLM
assumes independence of observations, the repeated measures within
individuals violate this assumption. As a result, the standard errors
and p-values may be underestimated, and inference should be interpreted
with caution. This motivates the subsequent use of correlation-aware
models such as GEE and GLMM.

\subsubsection{GLM Model Diagnostics}\label{glm-model-diagnostics}

Diagnostics were assessed for the GLM model.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{BIOS-667-Group-Project_files/figure-latex/glm-diagnostics-1.pdf}}

Figure 1 shows the residuals versus the fitted values. The absence of
strong patterns or fanning suggests that the linearity and
homoscedasticity assumptions are reasonably met.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{BIOS-667-Group-Project_files/figure-latex/glm-qqplot-1.pdf}}

Figure 2 presents a QQ plot of the residuals, which largely follow the
45 degree reference line with mild deviations in the tails. This
indicates that the normality assumption is approximately satisfied.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{BIOS-667-Group-Project_files/figure-latex/cooks-d-1.pdf}}

Finally, figure 3 displays Cook's distance for all observations. The
conventional threshold, 4/(n-k-1), where n is the number of observations
and k is the number of predictors, was used to assess the influence of
the observations. Several observations exceeded the threshold and were
considered potentially influential and warranted further investigation.
Therefore, a second GLM was fit, excluding those observations.

Observations)}\tabularnewline

(Intercept) & 36.597 & 2.449 & 14.946 & 0.000 \\
week & 0.276 & 0.084 & 3.284 & 0.001 \\

sexFemale & 3.217 & 1.008 & 3.193 & 0.001 \\
\end{longtable}

Excluding influential observations resulted in modest shifts in the
parameter estimates and slightly improved precision. Notably, the effect
of week and sex remained statistically significant. Overall, excluding
influential points slightly adjusted the estimates and improved
precision, but the main patterns of association were consistent with the
original GLM. As with the previous model, the GLM assumptions are not
appropriate for longitudinal data with correlated repeated measures. The
following GEE and GLMM analyses address this limitation by explicitly
modeling within-subject correlation and random effects.

\subsubsection{Generalized Estimating Equation
(GEE)}\label{generalized-estimating-equation-gee}

A GEE model with Gaussian family, identity link, and an exchangeable
correlation structure. The mean model included week, treatment,
treatment-by-week interaction, and baseline age and sex, with Placebo as
the reference treatment group.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{BIOS-667-Group-Project_files/figure-latex/gee-diagnostics-1.pdf}}

Figure 4 shows Pearson residuals plotted against the fitted TWSTRS
values with points colored by treatment group. The residuals are
centered around zero and do not show a strong funnel shape, supporting
the constant-variance assumption. However, many residuals fall outside
\(\pm2\), indicating wide individual variation in TWSTRS trajectories
and suggesting that the simple Gaussian working model does not fully
capture the variance structure. Even so, because the GEE analysis used
robust standard errors, the uncertainty in the regression coefficients
is driven by the observed variability of the residuals within subjects,
rather than depending on the working variance and correlation.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{BIOS-667-Group-Project_files/figure-latex/mean-profiles-1.pdf}}

Figure 5 shows mean TWSTRS over time by treatment group. All groups show
decreases from baseline through weeks 2--4, suggesting early
improvement, followed by increases after week 4. Around week 10, both
active treatment groups begin to show higher TWSTRS scores than the
placebo group.

week:treat10000 U & 0.323 & 0.146 & 4.899 & 0.027 \\
\end{longtable}

Table 4 summarizes the GEE estimates for TWSTRS over time by treatment,
adjusted for age and sex. The main effects for treat5000U (−0.810, p =
0.769) and treat10000U (−2.738, p = 0.248) compare baseline TWSTRS at
week 0 with placebo. Both estimates are negative but not statistically
significant, indicating no clear baseline differences in mean TWSTRS
between treatment groups and placebo. The treatment-by-week interaction
terms describe how each treatment's trajectory differs from placebo over
time. For 5000U, the additional slope relative to placebo is small and
not significant (0.115, p = 0.388), suggesting that its average linear
trend over time is similar to placebo. For 10000U, the additional slope
is larger and statistically significant (0.323, p = 0.027), indicating
an average increase in TWSTRS over 16 weeks compared with placebo.
Because higher TWSTRS scores reflect worse symptoms, these results imply
that low-dose regimen behaves similarly to placebo, while the high-dose
regimen is associated with faster worsening over time. Overall, the GEE
model provides a reasonable approach for assessing whether treatment
affects population-average TWSTRS trajectories over time, while
recognizing that the true time course is somewhat non-linear and that
estimated treatment effects are relatively small.

\subsubsection{Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model
(GLMM)}\label{generalized-linear-mixed-effects-model-glmm}

While the GEE model provides population-averaged estimates, we
implemented a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to model
subject-specific heterogeneity. By including a random intercept, the
GLMM partitions the total variance into between-subject and
within-subject components, allowing us to estimate treatment
trajectories conditional on an individual patient's unique baseline
severity. Additionally, because GLMM uses likelihood-based estimation,
they provide valid inference under the Missing at Random (MAR)
assumption.

Table 5 presents the fixed effect estimates from the linear mixed model.
Consistent with the previous GEE analysis, the point estimates for the
fixed effects are identical, as expected for a linear model with a
Gaussian distribution. However, the standard errors and p-values differ
slightly reflecting the distinction between model-based (GLMM) and
robust (GEE) variance estimation.

At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences in
disease severity between the treatment arms and the placebo group.
Neither age nor sex are significant predictors for TWSTRS. The primary
finding is the significant interaction between the 10000 U treatment and
week (\(\beta = 0.323, SE = 0.125, p = 0.010\)). This confirms that,
conditional on the individual patient, the high-dose group experienced a
significantly faster rate of worsening, increasing by approximately 0.32
points per week relative to the placebo group.

The ANOVA analysis shows that random slope model is not better than the
random intercept model.

Figure 6 illustrates the model-predicted trajectories for TWSTRS across
the three treatment groups. The blue line representing 10000 U treatment
and the red line for placebo cross each other, showing the significant
interaction term between 10000 U and week. The relationship between
treatment and score depends on time.

Figure 7 displays the observed TWSTRS scores (points) overlaying the
GLMM fitted trajectories (lines) for a random sample of 12 subjects. The
heterogeneity at baseline confirms the necessity of including a random
intercept for each subject to account for patient-specific
heterogeneity, suggesting that much of the variance arises from
pre-existing differences between patients.

The relationship between the solid lines and scattered points
demonstrates how the model generates Best Linear Unbiased Predictions
(BLUPs) for each subject. Instead of overfitting to the noisy
week-to-week fluctuations observed in the raw data points, the model
fits smooth linear trajectories that balance individual trends with the
overall population average.

The plot of Pearson residuals against fitted values (Figure 8) shows a
random scatter of points around the zero line without a distinct funnel
shape. This indicates that the assumption of constant variance
(homoscedasticity) is reasonably satisfied, and the linear mean
structure is adequate. The plot of residuals against time (Figure 9)
displays a slight non-linear trend. The dip suggests that the model is
overpredicting the TWSTRS scores around Weeks 4 and 5. However, the
residuals generally remain centered near zero, indicating the linear
approximation is adequate for the primary analysis.

The Q-Q plot for the random intercepts (Figure 10) assesses the
assumption that subject-specific deviations follow a normal
distribution. The points fall closely along the red diagonal reference
line, with only negligible deviations at the extreme tails. This
confirms that the assumption of normally distributed random effects is
well satisfied.

We also confirm that the model converged successfully.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

This study investigated longitudinal changes in cervical dystonia
severity following administration of botulinum toxin type B (BotB) using
data from a randomized clinical trial with three treatment arms:
placebo, 5000U, and 10000U. TWSTRS scores were collected at multiple
time points over a 16-week follow-up period, providing a
repeated-measures framework for evaluating differences in symptom
trajectories across treatment groups.

As an initial exploratory step, a generalized linear model (GLM) was fit
to examine associations between treatment, time, and relevant
demographic variables. However, because the GLM assumes independence of
observations and therefore ignores the within-subject correlation
inherent to repeated measures, its coefficient estimates cannot be
interpreted as valid inferential quantities. The GLM served primarily as
a descriptive benchmark, motivating the use of methods that explicitly
account for the covariance structure of longitudinal data. Accordingly,
inference was based on two widely used frameworks for repeated-measures
analysis: generalized estimating equations (GEE) and generalized linear
mixed models (GLMM).

Both GEE and GLMM yielded highly concordant fixed-effect estimates. At
baseline, neither active treatment group differed significantly from
placebo, and neither age nor sex exhibited meaningful associations with
initial severity or subsequent change. Across both modeling approaches,
the 5000U group showed no statistically detectable deviation from the
placebo trajectory, as evidenced by a nonsignificant treatment-by-time
interaction. In contrast, the 10000U group consistently demonstrated a
significantly more positive slope relative to placebo, indicating a
faster rate of symptom worsening over the 16-week period. Given that
higher TWSTRS scores correspond to greater clinical impairment, this
finding suggests that the higher dose may be associated with an adverse
rather than therapeutic longitudinal profile. The consistency of this
effect across both the marginal (GEE) and conditional (GLMM) modeling
frameworks strengthens the robustness of the conclusion.

Although the estimated treatment effects were similar across GEE and
GLMM, the two approaches target different estimands. GEE yields
population-averaged (marginal) effects, characterizing the mean response
pattern in the study population. GLMM, through inclusion of random
effects, generates subject-specific (conditional) estimates and
partitions variation into between-subject and within-subject components.
Model comparison indicated that a random-intercept structure was
sufficient to capture substantial heterogeneity in baseline TWSTRS
levels, whereas including random slopes did not improve model fit,
implying limited between-subject variability in rates of change.
Diagnostic evaluations supported the adequacy of the mixed-model
assumptions: random intercepts were approximately normally distributed,
fitted-versus-residual plots exhibited no major departures from
homoscedasticity, and residual-versus-time plots showed only mild
nonlinear patterns.

Because GEE and GLMM address different scientific aims, the choice
between them depends on whether inference is sought for marginal
population-level effects (favoring GEE) or for individual-level
trajectories and conditional effects (favoring GLMM). In this analysis,
both approaches converged on the same substantive conclusion: neither
the 5000U nor the 10000U dose of BotB produced improvement relative to
placebo, and the higher dose was associated with a significantly more
pronounced deterioration in symptoms over time.

Several limitations should be considered. First, modeling time as a
linear term simplifies an empirically nonlinear trajectory characterized
by early improvement followed by subsequent worsening. More flexible
time-varying specifications, such as spline-based or piecewise models,
may offer a more accurate representation of the underlying mean
structure. Second, the sample size within each treatment arm was modest,
limiting statistical power, particularly for detecting smaller
interaction effects or subtle differences in longitudinal profiles.
Third, the dataset lacked detailed clinical covariates that could
potentially account for heterogeneity in treatment response across
individuals. Future analyses incorporating richer baseline information,
nonlinear longitudinal modeling, and more frequent early follow-up
assessments would enable a more comprehensive characterization of
dose--response dynamics in cervical dystonia.
